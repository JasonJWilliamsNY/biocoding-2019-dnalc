   a safe and welcoming environemnt.

2. Everyone is to be treated with respect - there should be no name calling,
   insults, bullying, and/or profanity. If your jokes or other behavior
   makes other students or instructors uncomfortable, you must stop (and
   appropriately apologize) when asked to do so.

3. Everyone comes to this class with different background knowledge and
   experience. Disparaging remarks about anyone's performance in the class
   are uncalled for.
